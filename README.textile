h1. instagrammer

This is pretty complete at the moment, there are certain things that don't work (paging being the biggest most noticeable one) because for the life of me i just can't figure out the way the api returns the data, makes NO sense to me.  But anyways, yeah the example site is asp.net mvc 2 and all you have to do is open the solution and F5 that bitch and it'll spin up.

h1. notes

As mentioned above, just open the soltution file and F5 the Instagrammer.Example web project and it'll fire up (it's visual studio 2008 BTW)

The api wrapper is pretty well documented and should be easy to follow, you can drop the instagrammer.dll into your own project and use it as desired.
