h1. TODO

* add raw json,raw request url to response object
* have to pick a new name :(
  * instamin
* ditch the your photo's layout, it's too bulky and too much info at once, just piggy back userfeed
* move photo details to full page view, get rid of the light boxes
* add a delete link to comments that are yours
* need to track the current user so we can highlight your comments + add delete button
* start flushing out the README
* add support for passing in scope to authentication client
* add overloads for "self" calls, don't require the api user to pass in null either something or nothing.
* add the ability to comment on photo's in detail mode
* implement the realtime api
* ensure all api methods accept and pass additional params
  * start with paging
  * then move to search methods
  * lat long

h2. Tests

* some kind of tests (against the live api (functional) against stored json data (unit))
* unit testing against stored json data is brittle (especially since various aspects of the json are still changing and variable)

h2. ui ideas

* move away from the constrained site and let the header be at the top and un-attached from the content
* hipstervision.org
